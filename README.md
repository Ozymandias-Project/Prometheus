Prometheus is a project designed to store and organize design files, ideas, and various documents related to the production of websites. The primary goal is to provide a centralized repository that allows design and development teams to easily access shared resources and detailed documentation for each project.

## **Purpose of the Product**

The purpose of the product is to streamline the design and development of consistent, high-quality websites. Prometheus aims to standardize design processes, improve communication between teams, and reduce development time by providing clear guidelines and ready-to-use resources.

## **Examples of Documentation Include**

- **Canvas**: Detailed descriptions of fonts to use, object sizes, spacing, and other design elements.
- **Headings**: Guidelines for using different heading levels (H1, H2, H3, etc.), including font styles, sizes, and color schemes.
- **Colors**: A comprehensive color palette with specific color codes (HEX, RGB, CMYK) to maintain consistency across different projects.
- **Repeatable Design Examples**: Selection of online design examples that can be reused or adapted, along with ideas for inspiration.
- **Documentation of Each Component**: Detailed documentation of each web component, including its purpose, usage guidelines, and associated styles.
- **Responsive Design**: Best practices for ensuring that all designs are responsive and look great on different devices and screen sizes.

## **Creation of Components**

Components will be created using a consistent style and will be documented to ensure easy implementation and adaptability across various projects.

## **Tools Used**

For now, all designs and prototypes will be created and managed using **Figma**.

## **Key Sections to Include**

- **Hero Section**: Guidelines for designing the main section of a website, including layout examples, background images, headlines, and call-to-action elements.
